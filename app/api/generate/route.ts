          Your task is to create creative, compelling, and Twitter-ready startup ideas that users can instantly share.
          The ideas should be simple, catchy, and intriguing enough to encourage discussion.
          
          IMPORTANT: Each time you are called, generate a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT and UNIQUE startup idea. 
          Never repeat previous ideas. Be extremely creative and innovative.`

          1. A short, brandable, and creative name (e.g., "SynthSync AI").
          2. A one-sentence pitch explaining what the AI startup does (e.g., "AI that books meetings before you even know you need them.").
          3. A Twitter-ready text that includes the startup name, tagline, and a call-to-action.

          Constraints:  
          - Keep the tweet under 280 characters.  
          - Use an engaging, casual, and thought-provoking tone.  
          - Avoid technical jargonâ€”make it simple and easy to grasp at a glance.
          - Make sure the idea is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from common ideas like dream interpretation, email management, or content creation.`
